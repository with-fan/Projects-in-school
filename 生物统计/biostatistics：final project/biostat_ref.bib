  abstract = {INTRODUCTION(\#br)Postoperative sore throat is listed from the top as patients' most undesirable outcome in the postoperative period. It is believed to originate from mucosal dehydration or edema, tracheal ischemia secondary to the pressure of endotracheal tube cuffs, aggressive oropharyngeal suctioning, and mucosal erosion from friction between delicate tissues and the endotracheal tube. Even if the problem was indicated in many literatures, it has never been studied in our country. The study aimed to assess prevalence and factors associated with postoperative sore throat among patients who were operated under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.(\#br)METHODS(\#br)Hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from February 25 - April 10, 2014 in Gondar University hospital. Patient interview and chart review were employed for data collection. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the association.(\#br)RESULTS(\#br)A total of 240 out of 299 patients were included in this study with a response rate of 80.3\%. The prevalence of postoperative sore throat within 48 hours after operation was 59.6\%. Factors which had association with postoperative sore throat from the multivariate logistic regression were female sex (AOR = 3.3, 95\% CI: 1.07, 10.375), repeated number of attempts to intubate (AOR = 3.291, 95\% CI: 1.658, 6.531), and the use of nasogastric tube (AOR = 0.41, 95\% CI: 0.174, 0.965) respectively.(\#br)CONCLUSION(\#br)The prevalence of postoperative sore throat was high in Gondar University Hospital. Awareness creation about the problem should be made for health professionals and postoperative sore throat management protocol need to be introduced.},

  abstract = {Postoperative respiratory complications related to endotracheal intubation usually present as cough, sore throat, hoarseness. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of endotracheal tube cuff pressure changes during gynecological laparoscopic surgery on postoperative sore throat rates. Thirty patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery and 30 patients who underwent laparotomy under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were included. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the cuff was inflated to 25 mmHg. At 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after endotracheal intubation, cuff pressure and peak airway pressure were recorded. At 2 and 24 h after surgery, the patients were assessed for complaints of a sore throat. In patients who underwent laparotomy, cuff pressure and peak airway pressure did not change significantly at different time points after intubation. In patients who received laparoscopic surgery, cuff pressure and peak airway pressure were significantly increased compared to initial pressure at all examined time points. In both groups, the endotracheal tube cuff pressure and peak airway pressure were significantly correlated (R=0.9431, P{$<$}0.01; R=0.8468, P{$<$}0.01). Compared to patients who had undergone laparotomy, patients who had undergone laparoscopic surgery showed significantly higher sore throat scores at both 2 and 24 h after surgery (P{$<$}0.01). Pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position may increase airway pressure and cuff pressure, resulting in increased incidence of postoperative sore throat.},

  abstract = {With a large number of baseline covariates, we propose a new semi-parametric modeling strategy for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation and individualized treatment selection, which are two major goals in personalized medicine. We achieve the first goal through estimating a covariate-specific treatment effect (CSTE) curve modeled as an unknown function of a weighted linear combination of all baseline covariates. The weight or the coefficient for each covariate is estimated by fitting a sparse semi-parametric logistic single-index coefficient model. The CSTE curve is estimated by a spline-backfitted kernel procedure, which enables us to further construct a simultaneous confidence band (SCB) for the CSTE curve under a desired confidence level. Based on the SCB, we find the subgroups of patients that benefit from each treatment, so that we can make individualized treatment selection. The innovations of the proposed method are three-fold. First, the proposed method can quantify variability associated with the estimated optimal individualized treatment rule with high-dimensional covariates. Second, the proposed method is very flexible to depict both local and global associations between the treatment and baseline covariates in the presence of high-dimensional covariates, and thus it enjoys flexibility while achieving dimensionality reduction. Third, the SCB achieves the nominal confidence level asymptotically, and it provides a uniform inferential tool in making individualized treatment decisions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One small study suggests that gargling with licorice before induction of anesthesia reduces the risk of postoperative sore throat. Double-lumen tubes are large and thus especially likely to provoke sore throats. We therefore tested the hypothesis that preoperative gargling with licorice solution prevents postoperative sore throat and postextubation coughing in patients intubated with double-lumen tubes. METHODS: We enrolled 236 patients having elective thoracic surgery who required intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Patients were randomly assigned to gargle 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia for 1 minute with: (1) Extractum Liquiritiae Fluidum (licorice 0.5 g); or (2) Sirupus Simplex (sugar 5 g); each diluted in 30 mL water. Sore throat and postextubation coughing were evaluated 30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 4 hours after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit, and the first postoperative morning using an 11-point Likert scale by an investigator blinded to treatment. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative sore throat was significantly reduced in patients who gargled with licorice rather than sugar-water: 19\% and 36\% at 30 minutes, 10\% and 35\% at 1.5 hours, and 21\% and 45\% at 4 hours, respectively. The corresponding estimated treatment effects (relative risks) were 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.30–0.99, licorice versus sugar-water; P = 0.005), 0.31 (0.14–0.68) (P {$<$} 0.001), and 0.48 (0.28–0.83) (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Licorice gargling halved the incidence of sore throat. Preinduction gargling with licorice appears to be a simple way to prevent a common and bothersome complication.\hspace{1em}\,(Anesth Analg 2013;117:614–21)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND(\#br)Sore throat is a common side effect of general anaesthesia and is reported by between 30\% and 70\% of patients after tracheal intubation. The likelihood of a sore throat varies with the type, diameter, and cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube used. If intubation is essential, it may be helpful to give drugs prophylactically to alleviate postoperative sore throat. Local anaesthetics and steroids have been used for this purpose.(\#br)OBJECTIVES(\#br)The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and any harms of topical and systematic lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative sore throat in adults undergoing endotracheal intubation as part of general anaesthesia.(\#br)SEARCH STRATEGY(\#br)We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2007), and EMBASE (1980 to June 2007). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.(\#br)SELECTION CRITERIA(\#br)We included randomized controlled trials of topical and systemic prophylactic lidocaine therapy versus control (using air or saline) that reported on the risk and severity of postoperative sore throat as an outcome.(\#br)DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS(\#br)Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information, such as the risk of adverse effects.(\#br)MAIN RESULTS(\#br)We included 1232 patients from 15 studies; 672 patients received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 560 patients were allocated to the control group. Both the topical and systemic lidocaine therapy significantly reduced the risk of postoperative sore throat (risk ratio (RR) 0.58; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.82). To evaluate the severity of sore throat on a visual analogue scale (VAS), 219 patients received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 152 patients were allocated to the control groups. The severity of sore throat was reduced (mean difference (MD) -11.9; 95\% CI -16.44 to -7.32), an effect that neared statistical significance. The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies.(\#br)AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS(\#br)Our systematic review establishes the effectiveness of topical and systemic lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative sore throat resulting from intubation. The risk and severity of postoperative sore throat tended to be reduced. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by drug concentration and route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.}
